		<h1> <p> Marketing trends, we’re nearly at 2020, we can see the huge impact that digital marketing has had. Looking at advertising alone, these eMarketer predictions show how the duopoly of Facebook and Google dominate paid media investments online, although offline media</p> </h1><p>buys remain important for many larger brands.

SEO, social media, marketing automation, PPC, and more. New technologies, techniques, and ever-changing Google and Facebook algorithms keep many digital marketing teams on their toes, including ours. Part of our job is to stay</p><p>up-to-date on the upcoming trends so our clients’ digital marketing campaigns remain effective.

Posts That Sells

Social media has understandably become an integral part of online marketing. What may not be as obvious is just how many users shop on social media</p><p>networks. This represents a tremendous opportunity for businesses, given that 72% of Instagram users have purchased a product on the app. 

Even more impressive, a survey of more than 4,000 Pinterest users found that 70% use Pinterest to find new</p><p>and interesting products. Fortunately for merchants, these platforms have made it easier for them to use the power of social media to reach their customers. 

Whether you use Facebook, Pinterest or Instagram, there are now ways for e-commerce stores to</p><p>create shoppable posts, making it easy for users to shop directly from your post.

<b>Content that Interacts</b>

Buyers are looking for new experiences when they go online, and for many, that means greater interactivity. In fact, a whopping 91% are seeking more</p><p>visual and interactive content. There are several reasons for this:

• Interactive content is different and new, and as such, it stands out more.

• This type of content serves to keep visitors on your page longer.

• Interactive content is immensely shareable,</p><p>and when users share this content, it helps to grow awareness of your brand.

• Simply put, interactive content is more engaging. Users enjoy it more than other content.




Google Zero Click Position

Being No. 1 is no longer the goal.

The top spot</p><p>in SERP is now position zero, a featured snippet of text appearing above the search results. This prime location often provides information relating to the search query, while also providing a link to the page from which the information is</p> <center><img src="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/smiley-asian-woman-holding-coffee-mug_23-2148327015.jpg" alt="Trends" title="Trends" desc="Trends" style="width:98%; height:auto;" ></center><p>drawn.

Position zero is the first, and sometimes only, result that some users will view. As such, it is highly coveted and should be the focus of your efforts.

While many business owners appreciate the fact that marketing continues to change at</p><p>a fast pace, those who are willing to adapt and evolve will continue to attract high-quality customers in a digital world.



Personalized Ads

It is going to be the year of personalized marketing. Consumers are quite adept at tuning out generic ads</p><p>that have no real connection to them. Accordingly, traditional means of advertising are becoming much less effective. So, what can be done? Personalize it!

In a survey of 1,000 people, 90% remarked that they found personalization appealing. More important for your</p><h3>business is the fact that 80% admitted they’d be more likely to give their business to a company that offered them a personalized experience.

Email lists are an old standby of marketers, and they lend themselves well to personalization. Segmented lists</h3><p>with personalized email blasts have been shown to perform than generic emails sent to an entire list. Don’t miss this opportunity to connect with your audience in a meaningful way.</p>
